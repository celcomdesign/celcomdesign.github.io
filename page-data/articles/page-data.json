We construct wireframe design and prototypes to convey the message that we want to deliver to stakeholders. It’s a visual storytelling over siloed designs. <br />&nbsp;<br />As for graphic design, it is commonly associated with branding, marketing, and advertising of certain products or services. The idea is to create overall aesthetic of an artwork and focus on the visual elements. <br />&nbsp;<br />It is usually a lengthier process for UX design, where we need to gather requirements, go through design thinking process, user testing, stakeholder management, and so on. Logical thinking plays a key role here; however, even though everything will be controlled, creativity still matters as I will explain. <br />&nbsp;<br />Keeping in line with the consistency of a predetermined component design guideline is crucial for UX. Usually called design system, the guideline is generally overseen by a design system team that governs the consistent experience across all touch points of an organisation. That is how I can repurpose the creativity I harnessed as a graphic designer, by applying my previous creative experiences to create expressive icons and <Lottie animation icons>.

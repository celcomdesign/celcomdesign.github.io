It was an exciting time when Celcom was undergoing a substantial digital transformation (with IBMiX), introducing and developing multiple digital products (Portal, App, e-Commerce, Retail). <br />&nbsp;<br />As a Product Designer assigned to the mobile application track, my initial primary scope was to lead in participatory requirements gathering sessions and analyse stakeholder interviews to understand key success factors for a project or pursuit, and translate them into functional solutions (journeys, screen flows, and low and high fidelity prototypes). <br />&nbsp;<br />While we entered the post-revamp era along with digital transformation for the company’s mobile app, Celcom life 2.0 quickly received cosmetic (with dashboard and pay bill journey overhaul) upgrades over 1.0. Not long after BAU with mobile application track, familiarising myself with how business and the app works, I came across challenges that slowed (and blocked) us from becoming a great product.","image":null},{"_xcomponent":"content.image","id":2,"caption":"Celcom Life 1.0","quote":null,"title":null,"subtitle":null,"description":null,"image":{"data":{"attributes":{"alt":"Celcom Life 1.0","url":"/uploads/articles/celcom-life/2.png"}}}},{"_xcomponent":"content.image","id":1,"caption":"Celcom Life 2.0","quote":null,"title":null,"subtitle":null,"description":null,"image":{"data":{"attributes":{"alt":"Celcom Life 2.0","url":"/uploads/articles/celcom-life/3.png"}}}},{"_xcomponent":"content.text","id":3,"caption":null,"quote":null,"title":"Challenge #1:","subtitle":"Business and Design challenges: Celcom Life 2.0 itself","description":"IBMiX team was chasing deadlines with the 2.0 revamp; the revamp was built on top of legacy in hybrid mode, most of the features were just reskin and mirrored over 1.0.

The digital team, as the ONLY department that adopted the Agile way of working, faced difficulty and resistance working with other verticals. There was low (or no) design maturity throughout the organisation. Again, due to deadline chasing, there was not enough design advocation and education done. <br />&nbsp;<br />Even though the IBMiX team introduced personas to help put Business Owners in users’ shoes, most owners ignored the importance and value of user experience.

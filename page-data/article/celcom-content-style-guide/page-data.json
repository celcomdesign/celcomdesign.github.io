Nurture – We communicate with our customers to build long-lasting relationships. Our language is conversational and friendly, ensuring that empathy is at the forefront of every message.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Empower – We encourage our customers to understand and maximise the technology they’re using in their daily lives. Our messaging must aim to educate our customers, from newbies to the tech-savvy, or clarify anything related to our services, no matter how complex. <br />&nbsp;<br />3. Respect – We avoid hard-sell, vague or exaggerated language because we respect our customers’ time spent with us.

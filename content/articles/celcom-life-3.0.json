It was an exciting time when Celcom was undergoing a substantial digital transformation (with IBMiX), introducing and developing multiple digital products (Portal, App, e-Commerce, Retail). <br />&nbsp;<br />As a Product Designer assigned to the mobile application track, my initial primary scope was to lead in participatory requirements gathering sessions and analyse stakeholder interviews to understand key success factors for a project or pursuit, and translate them into functional solutions (journeys, screen flows, and low and high fidelity prototypes). <br />&nbsp;<br />While we entered the post-revamp era along with digital transformation for the company’s mobile app, Celcom life 2.0 quickly received cosmetic (with dashboard and pay bill journey overhaul) upgrades over 1.0. Not long after BAU with mobile application track, familiarising myself with how business and the app works, I came across challenges that slowed (and blocked) us from becoming a great product."

The digital team, as the ONLY department that adopted the Agile way of working, faced difficulty and resistance working with other verticals. There was low (or no) design maturity throughout the organisation. Again, due to deadline chasing, there was not enough design advocation and education done. <br />&nbsp;<br />Even though the IBMiX team introduced personas to help put Business Owners in users’ shoes, most owners ignored the importance and value of user experience. This made it particularly tough for the Agile team to sprint and push through user-friendly journeys when we always got “we/business want...” over “our customers need...” when it came to requirement discussions."

It took us some time to build up the Design System 2.0 to move everyone towards the new process, and not long after that, we had to restructure and repurpose some designers to serve the GTM module. This widened the design team’s gap in terms of purpose, scope, and deliveries."

I am grateful to have been given the trust and empowerment to realise this revamp plan. <br />&nbsp;<br />Along the way, I received full exposure to end-to-end app development, which further helped me especially when I needed to convey my thoughts and ideas to multiple parties in a discussion (business, designers, developers, QA, SA). I am now able to speak their language and make meetings more efficient. <br />&nbsp;<br />Out of the digital team, I have built trust with various business stakeholders. I learned business and numbers from them, and this made my design proposal more inclusive and persuasive. <br />&nbsp;<br />Another key thing I learnt is, to prove design values in business we need to be persistent (the way of work, the design method we use, the continuous advocation), and we should never compromise with any parties. <br />&nbsp;<br />And that is how I was selected as an Axiata Champion 2021 for Above and Beyond."
